INTRODUCTION  A large literature examines the link between ﬁrm fundamentals and future stock returns  . Typically, motivation for this line of research is that ﬁrm fundamentals are reﬂected in accounting data, which are informative about a ﬁrm’s future cash ﬂows, and that investors do not fully impound this information into stock prices. But since ﬁnancial statement information is backward-looking, it is beneﬁcial for investors to identify early indicators of ﬁrm fundamental changes that are not yet reﬂected in ﬁnancial statements. In this paper, we examine whether a change in analyst interest, proxied by either the onset of non-covering sell-side equity analysts who participate in a ﬁrm’s earnings conference call or by the absence of participation from covering analysts, is an early indicator of not only ﬁrm fundamental changes, but also of future capital market activities and stock returns.  Our focus on analyst interest stems from two observations. First, prior research shows that analysts are sophisticated experts with deep industry knowledge . Based on their knowledge of new products, customers, and market opportunities within an industry, analysts are keenly aware of shifting competitive positions between industry leaders, laggards, up-and-comers, and new entrant ﬁrms. Their expertise allows them to foresee future changes in ﬁrms’ fundamentals, well before such information is reﬂected in the ﬁnancial statements of individual ﬁrms. Second, before an analyst initiates coverage on a ﬁrm, he or she must conduct due diligence. Analyst due diligence has not been explored in the extant literature, as many of the activities analysts perform before and after coverage initiations have been described as a black box . We explore one aspect of analyst due diligence and document that analysts regularly participate in a ﬁrm’s earnings conference calls before initiating coverage on the ﬁrm.1 This practice is common because listening to and asking a question during a ﬁrm’s conference call is part of an extensive, and sometimes lengthy, due diligence process. For example, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., a top-ranked sell-side equity research ﬁrm in Institutional Investor’s annual All-American Research Survey, gives newly hired analysts up to one year to conduct due diligence on ﬁrms before initiating coverage on them . In a similar vein, analysts who already cover a ﬁrm are often absent from, or silent on , the ﬁrm’s conference call if they have lost interest in the ﬁrm or intend to drop coverage.2  We posit that an onset of analysts who do not cover a given ﬁrm , but participate in that ﬁrm’s earnings conference call, captures increasing analyst interest in the ﬁrm, while analyst absenteeism captures decreasing analyst interest in the ﬁrm. A change in analyst  1 Two examples come from our data. First, Asset Acceptance Capital Corp held its ﬁrst-ever earnings conference call on March 10, 2004. But as of that date, no sell-side analysts had initiated coverage on the ﬁrm. Yet, during the question-and-answer  portion of the call, six people asked management a question. According to the transcript, three of the questioners were sell-side analysts, one was a buy-side analyst, and two provided no employer afﬁliation. After that call, two of the sell-side analysts subsequently initiated coverage on the ﬁrm, one on March 16  and the other on April 2 . A second example is from Bebe Stores Inc., which had seven sell-side analysts participate in its April 22, 2002 earnings conference call, six of which ofﬁcially covered the ﬁrm. The one analyst who was not yet covering the ﬁrm subsequently initiated coverage on May 1, 2002 . 2 For example, Morgan Stanley discontinued coverage on Computer Sciences Corp. on March 23, 2006 . The Morgan Stanley analyst participated in the earnings conference call on November 3, 2005, but not the one on February 7, 2006. We note that we cannot distinguish between cases in which an analyst did not dial into a conference call  or dialed into a call, but did not ask a question . Any misclassiﬁcation on our part would add measurement error to our empirical proxy for covering analysts who are absent .  The Accounting Review May 2015  \\x0cAnalyst Interest as an Early Indicator of Firm Fundamental Changes and Stock Returns  1051  interest serves as an early indicator of a change in future ﬁrm fundamentals, capital market activities, and stock returns. Our proposition stems from two non-mutually exclusive theories. The ﬁrst theory is from McNichols and O’Brien , who show that analysts allocate effort toward ﬁrms in which they view future prospects to be favorable and curtail effort in ﬁrms with poor prospects or whose coverage is likely to be discontinued.3 This theory suggests that analyst interest—our measure of analyst effort prior to coverage initiation or termination—predicts future reported ﬁrm fundamentals, analyst coverage, and stock returns. The second theory is from Merton , who shows that investor recognition of a ﬁrm affects the ﬁrm’s cost of capital and stock price. This theory suggests that a change in analyst interest leads to a change in investor recognition of a ﬁrm , especially among institutional investors, given their broker- client relationships with sell-side analysts, as well as a change in stock price.  While most indicators of an analyst’s early interest or disinterest in a ﬁrm are unobservable, conference call participation and absenteeism are observable through available transcripts. Conceptually, our measure of increasing analyst interest is based on an observable aspect of analysts’ due diligence prior to their formal issuance of earnings forecasts, price targets, and stock recommendations to the public. Similarly, our measure of decreasing analyst interest is based on the observable lack of participation by a covering analyst during the conference call. Our analyst interest measures have two appealing practical attributes: almost all questioners are sell-side equity analysts, enabling us to capture the interest of sophisticated experts,4 and virtually all public ﬁrms hold quarterly earnings conference calls, allowing for a large sample of ﬁrms with variation in size and existing levels of analyst following.  Using a sample of conference call transcripts from 2002 through the ﬁrst quarter of 2009, we create two measures to capture analysts’ early interest and disinterest in a ﬁrm. We deﬁne NC_ ANALYSTS as the number of non-covering analysts who ask a question during the conference call, and COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT as the number of covering analysts who asked a question during the prior quarter’s conference call, but are absent  during the current conference call, both scaled by the total number of callers on the current conference call.5 We ﬁnd that NC_ ANALYSTS is positively associated with proxies for future changes in ﬁrm fundamentals, earnings per share , and sales growth, up to four quarters ahead, after controlling for other factors. We also ﬁnd that NC_ANALYSTS is positively associated with a change in the next quarter’s analyst coverage, institutional ownership, and trading volume. The results are consistent with our prediction that an increase in analyst interest in a ﬁrm is an early indicator of improvement in future reported ﬁrm fundamentals and capital market activities in the stock. Finally, we ﬁnd that NC_ANALYSTS predicts future stock returns, over and above the ﬁrm’s earnings surprise, size, the book-to-market the aforementioned changes in capital market activities. Subsequent three-month stock returns increase monotonically from 1.69 percent in the bottom NC_ANALYSTS quartile to 3.56 percent in the top quartile, resulting in a signiﬁcant hedge portfolio return of 1.87 percent. After controlling for common return factors, the hedge portfolio yields a signiﬁcant abnormal return of 0.475 percent per month or 5.7 percent per year. The magnitude of the hedge return is  ratio, and the past 11-month return, and after controlling for  3 Consistent with this notion, Ertimur, Muslu, and Zhang  document that coverage initiations are mostly started with a Buy rating. In particular, about 68 percent of initiations are started with a Strong Buy or Buy rating, compared to 3 percent of initiations started with a Strong Sell or Sell rating.  4 We ﬁnd that over 92 percent of the questioners on earnings conference calls are afﬁliated with a sell-side brokerage ﬁrm. The remaining questioners are either institutional investors  or not identiﬁable due to a vague or incomplete name or afﬁliation.  5 We require covering analysts to have been on the previous conference call to distinguish them from covering analysts  who never participate in a ﬁrm’s conference call.  The Accounting Review May 2015  \\x0c1052  Jung, Wong, and Zhang  economically signiﬁcant, especially given the fact that many trading strategies have not worked well in the past ten years .6  In contrast, COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT exhibits no statistical association with proxies for ﬁrm fundamental changes or trading volume. However, it is signiﬁcantly and negatively related to a change in the next quarter’s analyst coverage and institutional ownership. These ﬁndings provide some evidence that a drop in analyst interest is an early indicator of a decrease in capital market activities. We also ﬁnd that COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT predicts future stock returns. Subsequent three-month stock returns decrease from 3.15 percent in the bottom COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT quartile to 1.48 percent in the top quartile, resulting in a statistically signiﬁcant return difference of 1.67 percent.  We rule out a number of alternative explanations for our results, including confounding information, an upward trend in conference call data, microstructure effects, and investor overreaction. We also conduct several additional tests and robustness checks. We partition our sample into three groups based on the level of existing analyst coverage, and ﬁnd the effects of analyst interest to be more pronounced for low-coverage  ﬁrms. We also ﬁnd that our results are robust to alternative speciﬁcations of the analyst interest variables. Finally, we show that our results are not driven by initial public offering  ﬁrms or fourth-quarter observations.  This study contributes to the extant literature in three unique ways. First, it adds to the literature examining the link between ﬁrm fundamentals and future stock returns. Since ﬁnancial statements are backward-looking, accounting information may not be timely with respect to changes in ﬁrm fundamentals. We show that an awareness of changing analyst interest in a ﬁrm can provide investors with an early indicator of a ﬁrm’s fundamental changes that are not yet reﬂected in its ﬁnancial statements. Second, our study contributes to the literature on sell-side analysts by highlighting one aspect of their due diligence process prior to their formal issuance of earnings forecasts, price targets, and stock recommendations to the public and, hence, adds to our understanding of the role analysts play in the capital markets. Our measure of increasing analyst interest, based on pre-coverage due diligence, also distinguishes our study from the prior literature on analyst discrimination  because the views of the non-covering analysts are not yet known to the ﬁrm managers prior to the conference calls . Finally, our study adds to prior studies least documenting the information content of conference calls and their effects on analysts covering the ﬁrms . that analyst participation or absenteeism can be a measure of analyst interest in a ﬁrm and, moreover, is informative about their future coverage decisions.  In particular, we highlight  This paper continues as follows. The next section develops testable hypotheses. Section III describes the sample and variable construction. Section IV presents the empirical ﬁndings. Section V discusses alternative explanations and robustness tests. We conclude in Section VI.  II. HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT  Prior studies examine extensively the link between accounting data and future stock returns. Bernard and Thomas  ﬁnd that investors do not fully understand the implications of current earnings for future earnings, leading to predictable return drifts in the four quarters subsequent to earnings announcements. Similarly, Sloan  shows that investors do not understand the differential implications of the accrual and cash ﬂow components of current earnings for future earnings. Thus, a hedge portfolio based on extreme deciles of accruals earns signiﬁcant  6 Plenty of anecdotal evidence suggests poor performance for quantitative-based trading strategies. For example, Goldman Sachs closed its Global Alpha hedge fund, which relied on computer-driven trading strategies, in 2011.  The Accounting Review May 2015  \\x0cAnalyst Interest as an Early Indicator of Firm Fundamental Changes and Stock Returns  1053  abnormal returns. Ou and Penman  and Abarbanell and Bushee  show that fundamental signals constructed from accounting data have predictive power for future earnings and, thus, predict future stock returns. Similarly, Holthausen and Larcker  and Lev and Thiagarajan  ﬁnd that accounting-based fundamental signals are value-relevant over contemporaneous earnings. Finally, Abarbanell and Bushee  ﬁnd that a trading strategy based on these fundamental signals generates an average 12-month cumulative size-adjusted return of 13.2 percent, suggesting that contemporaneous stock returns do not fully reﬂect the implications of the fundamental signals for future earnings. In sum, this literature establishes that predicting ﬁrm fundamentals is central to the analysis and valuation of stocks.  One of the most important roles for sell-side equity analysts is predicting ﬁrms’ future fundamentals and stock valuations . Given their deep industry knowledge, analysts are aware of ﬁrms’ shifting competitive positions well before such information is reﬂected in the ﬁnancial statements and stock prices of individual ﬁrms. Accordingly, their fundamental analyses and predictions published in written reports have been shown to be informative to the markets . We exploit two important institutional regularities within the analyst coverage process to develop an early indicator of a ﬁrm’s prospects. First, before an analyst initiates coverage on a ﬁrm, he or she requires a certain amount of time and effort to become informed about the ﬁrm . The amount of time needed to complete due diligence varies from a minimum of several weeks to one year.7 Since earnings conference calls occur every quarter, there is ample opportunity for an analyst to participate in a ﬁrm’s call before initiating coverage on the ﬁrm. Second, while most analysts who already cover a ﬁrm actively participate in the ﬁrm’s conference call each quarter, it is not uncommon for some analysts to be silent or possibly absent from the call. We posit that such absence results from a loss of interest in the ﬁrm and a possible intention to drop coverage. Taken together, these two scenarios within the analyst coverage process can provide an early indication about a ﬁrm’s fundamentals and prospects.  Our proposition that changes in analyst interest in a ﬁrm predict future fundamental changes, capital market activities, and stock returns is based upon two non-mutually exclusive theories. The ﬁrst is from McNichols and O’Brien , who show that analysts allocate effort toward ﬁrms in which they view future prospects to be favorable. The fact that over two-thirds of analyst coverage initiations are started with a Buy or Strong Buy rating  is consistent with analysts having exerted effort to learn about and initiate coverage on ﬁrms in which the positive fundamentals are not yet reﬂected in ﬁnancial statements or stock prices. The ﬁndings in McNichols and O’Brien  also indicate that analysts curtail effort toward ﬁrms with poor prospects or whose coverage is likely to be discontinued. This theory suggests that analyst interest—our measure of analyst effort prior future ﬁrm fundamentals, analyst coverage, and stock returns. The second theory is from Merton , who shows that investor recognition of a ﬁrm affects the ﬁrm’s cost of capital and stock price. This theory suggests that a change in analyst interest should lead to a change in investor recognition of a ﬁrm , especially among institutional investors, given their broker-client relationships with sell-side analysts, and a change in stock price.8  termination—should predict  to coverage initiation or  7 Analysts vary in their speed to initiate coverage on ﬁrms. Our conversations with a number of sell-side analysts indicate that a lower bound of three weeks is not unreasonable. Due diligence tasks include analyzing past ﬁnancial statements, preparing models and forecasts, visiting company sites, meeting management, listening to archived conference calls, drafting and editing an initiation report, and receiving approval from the brokerage ﬁrm’s research executive management. The upper bound of 365 days is based on anecdotes of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. allowing newly hired analysts up to one year to learn about a ﬁrm prior to initiation of coverage .  8 Lehavy and Sloan , Da, Engelberg, and Gao , and Drake, Roulstone, and Thornock  document  evidence consistent with the prediction of Merton’s  investor recognition story.  The Accounting Review May 2015  \\x0c1054  Jung, Wong, and Zhang  Of the two theories, only the one from McNichols and O’Brien  suggests an association between early analyst interest in a ﬁrm and that ﬁrm’s future fundamentals. This difference provides us with one prediction by which to distinguish between these two theories. If analysts exert effort to learn about ﬁrms with positive prospects, then analyst participation in a ﬁrm’s earnings conference call prior to coverage initiation should capture analysts’ pre-initiation effort and positive views about that ﬁrm. Such views can eventually be discussed in the analysts’ written initiation reports and reﬂected in their forecasts of sales and earnings. Analogously, if analysts foresee negative prospects for a ﬁrm that is already covered and lose interest in participating in that ﬁrm’s earnings conference call, then the lack of participation can indicate a possible future downgrade or termination of coverage. In sum, we predict that increases in analyst interest are associated with future improvement in ﬁrm fundamentals, while decreases in analyst interest are associated with future deterioration in ﬁrm fundamentals:  Prediction 1: Increases  in analyst interest are associated with future improvement   in ﬁrm fundamentals.  In contrast to the ﬁrst prediction, a second prediction suggesting that early analyst interest is associated with subsequent capital market activities is supported by both theories. Under the McNichols and O’Brien  theory, some of the non-covering analysts who participate in a ﬁrm’s conference calls due to expectations of improving fundamentals will eventually initiate coverage on the ﬁrm. Increased analyst coverage, especially with positive recommendations, will attract more institutional investors and institutional trading in the stock. Under the Merton  theory, more institutional investors will become informed about a ﬁrm’s prospects through conversations with the analysts. With increased interest from institutional investors, future trading volume also increases. These interactions between analysts and investors suggest that increases  in analyst interest are associated with future increases  in capital market activities, such as analyst coverage, institutional ownership, and trading volume:  Prediction 2: Increases  in analyst interest are associated with future increases  in analyst coverage, institutional ownership, and trading volume.  Finally, both theories suggest that analyst interest predicts future stock returns. Under the McNichols and O’Brien  theory, analysts follow ﬁrms with positive prospects, and future stock prices will reﬂect the future improvement in ﬁrm fundamentals. Under the Merton  theory, higher analyst interest in a ﬁrm leads to greater recognition from institutional investors, which will lead to lower cost of capital and higher demand and valuation for the ﬁrm’s stock. Conversely, a loss of interest from analysts will be reﬂective of poor prospects for a ﬁrm, and a loss of interest from institutional investors will lead to a decline in demand and valuation for a ﬁrm’s stock:  Prediction 3: Increases  in analyst interest are positively  associated  with future stock returns.  In summary, we posit that increases  in analyst interest capture improvements  in ﬁrm fundamentals that are not yet reﬂected in ﬁnancial statements. Thus, changes in analyst interest serve as an early indicator of future changes in reported ﬁrm fundamentals, capital market activities, and stock returns.  III. DATA AND VARIABLE DEFINITIONS  Our data are comprised of ﬁrms with available conference call transcripts from the Thomson Reuters StreetEvents database from the ﬁrst quarter of 2002 through the ﬁrst quarter of 2009. The  The Accounting Review May 2015  \\x0cAnalyst Interest as an Early Indicator of Firm Fundamental Changes and Stock Returns  1055  transcripts contain identifying information about the ﬁrm managers on the call, as well as the name and afﬁliation of anyone who asked a question during the question-and-answer  portion of the call.9 There are transcripts from many types of conference calls, including calls about technology announcements, sales and marketing initiatives, mergers and acquisitions, restructur- ings, and earnings announcements. However, only earnings calls are scheduled far in advance, with analysts well aware of the exact date and time of the call, making conference call participation a logical measure of analyst interest. In addition, many of the non-earnings calls do not have a Q&A portion. Therefore, we use only the transcripts of quarterly earnings conference calls of U.S. ﬁrms, resulting in a sample of 55,565 conference calls from 3,370 ﬁrms.10 Table 1, Panel A provides a breakdown of the sample conference calls by year and quarter.11  From each ﬁrm’s conference call transcript, we identify those on the call who are sell-side equity analysts using two procedures. First, a caller is identiﬁed as an analyst if the last name, ﬁrst initial, and brokerage afﬁliation match the equivalent information contained in the I/B/E/S Detail Recommendations ﬁle.12 For cases in which there is no match, we check for possible misspellings of the names and afﬁliations on the transcripts and manually identify the callers as analysts when it is obvious that the initial mismatch was due to a simple misspelling. With this procedure, we identify 80.5 percent of the callers as I/B/E/S sell-side analysts. Second, callers are also identiﬁed as sell-side analysts if their afﬁliation is a brokerage ﬁrm that does not report to I/B/E/S, such as Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, BB&T Capital Markets, Wachovia, and SG Cowen. We identify 11.7 percent of the callers as non-I/B/E/S sell-side analysts. The remaining 7.8 percent of callers are either institutional investors or buy-side analysts  or not identiﬁable due to a vague or incomplete name or afﬁliation.13  For each caller classiﬁed as a sell-side equity analyst tracked by I/B/E/S, we obtain the unique analyst code used by I/B/E/S to identify that analyst’s earnings estimates or recommendations for a given ﬁrm.14 We then determine whether the analyst on the earnings conference call has initiated coverage on the ﬁrm prior to the date of the conference call. Speciﬁcally, if an analyst is on a ﬁrm’s earnings conference call, but has not yet issued any earnings estimates or recommendations at any time during the 12 months prior to the call, then we classify that analyst as a non-covering analyst. All other analysts have issued earnings estimates or recommendations prior to the conference call  9 A better measure of analyst interest in a ﬁrm would be the number of analysts who dial into and listen to the ﬁrm’s earnings conference call. However, such information is not available on transcripts. Therefore, the number of analysts who ask a question is the next-best alternative.  10 We require that the date of a ﬁrm’s conference call  be the same or one day after the date of the earnings announcement provided by Compustat. We ﬁnd that 78 percent of the conference calls occur on the same date as the earnings announcement and 22 percent occur on the next day.  11 Any ﬁrm that hosts an earnings conference call in which no analysts ask a question is excluded from our sample. Such exclusions are rare, as we ﬁnd that 97.5 percent of earnings conference call transcripts for U.S. ﬁrms in the StreetEvents database from the ﬁrst quarter of 2002 through the ﬁrst quarter of 2009 are included in our ﬁnal sample .  12 In the I/B/E/S Detail Recommendations ﬁle, an analyst’s last name and ﬁrst initial are identiﬁed in the variable called ANALYST and the brokerage afﬁliation is identiﬁed in a variable called ESTIMID. In rare cases in which a brokerage ﬁrm employs two analysts with the same last name and ﬁrst initial, we distinguish the correct analyst by additionally matching on ﬁrm or industry. That is, the analyst must have covered the ﬁrm on the transcript  either before or after the conference call date, or must have at least covered a ﬁrm in the same two- digit Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation  code as the ﬁrm on the transcript.  13 The latter group includes callers who cannot be matched to an analyst in the I/B/E/S ﬁle, even after checking for misspellings of the name and brokerage afﬁliation. The participation of these analysts in a ﬁrm’s conference call is very rare, and our results are virtually unchanged if we include these analysts in the sample.  14 A given analyst’s unique identiﬁer in I/B/E/S is a six-digit number labeled as AMASKCD in the Detail Recommendations ﬁle and as ANALYS in the Detail History Earnings per Share ﬁle. Although the identiﬁer is labeled as two different variable names in the two ﬁles, it is the same number for a given analyst.

Panel A presents the sample of earnings conference call transcripts by year and calendar quarter. Panel B presents descriptive statistics of variables for the entire conference call transcript sample. Panels C and D present Pearson pair- wise correlations. Variables not shown below are deﬁned in Appendix A.  Variable Deﬁnitions: NUMCALLERS ¼ number of analysts that asked a question on the ﬁrm’s conference call; NC_ANALYSTS ¼ number of analysts that asked a question on the ﬁrm’s conference call, but did not cover the ﬁrm as of  the date of the conference call, scaled by NUMCALLERS;  COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT ¼ number of analysts that covered the ﬁrm as of the date of the conference call, did not ask a question on the conference call, but did ask a question on the previous conference call, scaled by NUMCALLERS;  NAN ¼ number of analysts that covered the ﬁrm as of the date of the conference call; CNANtþ1 ¼ percentage change in the number of analysts that covered the ﬁrm; NII ¼ number of institutional investors that owned the ﬁrm’s stock as of the most recent calendar quarter ended prior to  the conference call;  CNIItþ1 ¼ percentage change in NII; CTURNOVERtþ1 ¼ change in average daily turnover; DEPStþ1 ¼ seasonal difference in earnings per share; SGROWTHtþ1 ¼ seasonal percentage change in quarterly sales for the ﬁscal quarter ended after the conference call; SIZE ¼ natural logarithm of the market value of equity; ROA ¼ income before extraordinary items divided by total assets; BTM ¼ book value of equity divided by market value of equity; LEVERAGE ¼ book value of debt divided by book value of equity; PASTRET ¼ size-adjusted past return; and VOLATILITY ¼ standard deviation of daily size-adjusted returns.  The Accounting Review May 2015  \\x0c1058  Jung, Wong, and Zhang  COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT as the number of covering analysts who were on the prior quarter’s conference call, but are absent from, or silent on, the current conference call, scaled by NUMCALLERS.15 Descriptive statistics of these variables are provided in Table 1, Panel B. The mean number of callers is 5.1, of which 1.1 are non-covering analysts and 4.0 are covering analysts. The mean values of NC_ANALYSTS and COV_ANALYSTS are 0.25 and 0.75, respectively. Unscaled COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT has a mean value of 1.2 and a scaled mean value of 0.30.  We note several sources of measurement error  in our variables of interest. NC_ ANALYSTS only captures non-covering analysts who ask a question, so to the extent that there are non-covering analysts who listen to a call, but do not ask a question, our measure of increasing analyst interest will be understated. A similar measurement error exists with COV_ANALYSTS_ ABSENT. Although we require a covering analyst to have asked a question during the prior conference call , that analyst may not be absent on the current conference call, but instead simply does not ask a question, in which case, our measure of decreasing analyst interest will be overstated. Most importantly, while a lengthy analyst due diligence process suggests that an analyst is likely to participate in a ﬁrm’s conference call before initiating coverage, it does not suggest that an analyst would be absent from a conference call before that covering analysts drop coverage before they stop dropping coverage. To the extent participating in a given ﬁrm’s conference calls, COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT will be understated in measuring decreasing analyst interest. Therefore, we expect relatively more noise in COV_ ANALYSTS_ABSENT, which tends to attenuate the coefﬁcients toward zero more so than the coefﬁcients on NC_ANALYSTS in our regressions if the noise is uncorrelated with the other independent variables.16  To measure ﬁrm fundamentals, capital market activities, and future stock returns, we obtain ﬁnancial statement data from Compustat, stock data from CRSP, institutional holdings data from the Thomson Reuters Form 13F database, and earnings estimates from I/B/E/S. We choose EPS growth and sales growth to proxy for ﬁrm fundamentals because they are arguably the two most emphasized metrics in ﬁrms’ quarterly earnings announcements. Also, analysts typically forecast EPS and sales, and the most common valuation models used by analysts are based on EPS  and EPS growth  . We measure EPS growth  as the seasonal difference in diluted EPS excluding extraordinary items, measured one to four quarters after the conference call , scaled by the ﬁrm’s stock price on the last day of the ﬁscal quarter ended prior to the conference call. We measure sales growth as the seasonal percentage change in quarterly sales , measured one to four quarters after the conference call . We use analyst coverage, institutional ownership, and trading volume to capture capital market activities. To capture existing analyst coverage at the time of a given conference call, we measure the number of analysts  that issued an earnings estimate to I/B/E/S at any time between the previous conference call date and one day before the current conference call. We measure the next quarter’s change in analyst coverage  as the percentage change in NAN from quarter t to tþ1. Thus, CNANtþ1 requires one lag quarter of data and captures the change in total analyst coverage from the period before the conference call  to the period after the call. We  15 In robustness checks, we use unscaled versions of NC_ANALYSTS and COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT in the empirical analyses discussed in Section IV. In untabulated results, we ﬁnd results that are similar to those presented in Tables 2 through 4. For the portfolio return tests in Table 5, we partition the sample into three  groups because there is not enough variation in the unscaled versions of NC_ANALYSTS and COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT to form quartiles in some quarters. Untabulated results indicate that our results hold using unscaled versions of the variables of interest.  16 It is interesting to point out that the coefﬁcients on COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT are smaller in magnitude than those on  NC_ANALYSTS in all our regressions, a result consistent with the greater expected measurement error.  The Accounting Review May 2015  \\x0cAnalyst Interest as an Early Indicator of Firm Fundamental Changes and Stock Returns  1059  deﬁne institutional ownership as the number of institutional investors  that own a ﬁrm’s stock as of the most recent calendar quarter ended prior to the ﬁrm’s conference call. We compute the next quarter’s change in institutional investors  as the percentage change in NII from the calendar quarter ended prior to the conference call to the calendar quarter ended after the conference call. We deﬁne a ﬁrm’s next quarter change in trading volume turnover  as the change in average daily turnover  from the 90 calendar days before to the 90 calendar days after the conference call, expressed in percentage terms.  We measure a ﬁrm’s future stock return  over the three-month period [mþ1, mþ3], where m is the month in which the conference call occurs. In robustness checks, we also measure two- and three-quarter-out stock returns, which are measured over the [mþ4, mþ6] and [mþ7, mþ9] windows, respectively.  We include several control variables in our analyses, including ﬁrm and stock characteristics measured prior to the conference call. When testing the association between analyst interest and future EPS and sales growth, we control for the current quarter’s EPS and sales growth. We also control for ﬁrm size using the logarithm of market value of equity , performance with income before extraordinary items divided by total assets , valuation using the book value of equity divided by market value of equity , and leverage with the book value of debt divided by the book value of equity . PASTRET is the size-adjusted return  for the period [91, 1], where day 0 is the date of the conference call. In the regressions of future capital market activities, we also control for stock volatility , deﬁned as the standard deviation of daily size-adjusted returns for the period [91, 1]. In the stock return regressions, we control for the most recent earnings surprise , SIZE, BTM, and the past 11-month return 1,m11) from the [m11, m1] period, where m is the month in which the conference call occurs. Finally, in the four-factor model, we use the RMt  Rft, SMB, and HML factors deﬁned in Fama and French  and the momentum factor  deﬁned in Carhart . Appendix A summarizes all the variable deﬁnitions described above.  Table 1, Panel B shows descriptive statistics of the variables. The median values for DEPStþ1 and SGROWTHtþ1 are 0.00 and 0.10, respectively, indicating that ﬁrms are exhibiting higher top- line growth than bottom-line growth. The median ﬁrm is covered by six analysts . The mean and median future percentage changes in the number of analysts  are 0.05 and 0.00, respectively, and the interquartile range is from 0.06 to 0.13. These statistics indicate that for the median ﬁrm, analyst coverage is stable from quarter to quarter, but there is variation and a slightly right-skewed distribution in the change variable. The mean  CNIItþ1 is 0.02 , indicating that the number of institutional investors, on average, increases about 1 to 2 percent each quarter for our sample ﬁrms. CTURNOVERtþ1 has a mean value of 0.04 percent, indicating a small increase in daily trading volume each quarter, on average, for the sample ﬁrms. Panels C and D in Table 1 show pair-wise correlations. As expected, NC_ANALYSTS is positively correlated with future changes in ﬁrm fundamentals  and capital market activities . Also as expected, COV_ ANALYSTS_ABSENT is negatively correlated with SGROWTHtþ1, CNANtþ1, CNIItþ1, and CTURNOVERtþ1. Furthermore, NC_ANALYSTS and COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT are negatively correlated, as one would expect. In terms of the control variables, NC_ANALYSTS is negatively correlated with ﬁrm size  and performance  and positively associated with ﬁrm leverage  and stock volatility , consistent with the notion that analysts tend to exert effort to learn about neglected ﬁrms that are difﬁcult to understand.17 Finally, only two  17 Becoming an expert on neglected ﬁrms that are difﬁcult to understand can increase an analyst’s visibility among investors and improve his or her career opportunities in the analyst labor market. We thank an  institutional anonymous reviewer for raising this point.  The Accounting Review May 2015  \\x0c1060  Jung, Wong, and Zhang  pairs of variables are highly correlated with each other with a correlation above j0.40j: SIZE and VOLATILITY, and LEVERAGE and BTM.18  IV. EMPIRICAL ANALYSES  Future Change in Firm Fundamentals  In the ﬁrst part of our analyses, we examine whether NC_ANALYSTS and COV_ANALYSTS_ ABSENT have predictive power for future changes in ﬁrm fundamentals. We estimate the following regression model :  CFUNDAx ¼ b0 þ b1NC ANALYSTSt þ b2COV ANALYSTS ABSENTt þ b3CFUNDAt  þ b4SIZEt þ b5ROAt þ b6BTMt þ b7LEVERAGEt þ b8PASTRETt þ Year Fixed Effects þ e;  ð1Þ  where CFUNDAx is either DEPSx or SGROWTHx . Prediction 1 states that the estimated coefﬁcients on NC_ANALYSTSt and COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENTt should be positive and negative, respectively.  We control for the current-quarter change in ﬁrm fundamental CFUNDAt . The estimated coefﬁcient on CFUNDAt depends on the time-series property of CFUNDAt. For DEPS, we expect it to be serially positively correlated in the ﬁrst three lags and negatively correlated in the fourth lag . For SGROWTH, we expect it to follow an autoregressive process, with a nonnegative coefﬁcient decreasing with x. We include other contemporaneous ﬁrm characteristics to control for cross-sectional differences that may explain the variations in CFUNDAx, although the relations between such factors and EPS growth and sales growth may differ. Firm size  captures a ﬁrm’s market power and competitive position, which should be positively associated with earnings power . However, smaller ﬁrms generally have higher sales growth potential than larger ﬁrms and, hence, we expect SIZE to be negatively associated with SGROWTHt. Operating performance  is expected to have negative coefﬁcients, as ﬁrms with high existing levels of earnings are less likely to have higher EPS growth and sales growth. Book-to-market  is a proxy for a ﬁrm’s investment opportunity set. Since ﬁrms with low BTM exhibit higher growth, we expect a negative coefﬁcient on BTM. Leverage  captures the capital structure of the ﬁrm and, all else being equal, ﬁrms with higher leverage should exhibit higher earnings growth, but the expected effect of LEVERAGEt on sales growth is less clear. We include past stock return  to control for confounding events, such as industry-speciﬁc news or managerial voluntary disclosures, that may drive both analyst interest and future ﬁrm fundamentals, and we expect PASTRETt to have a positive coefﬁcient.19  Table 2, Panel A shows the results of the DEPSx regressions. We cluster standard errors by ﬁrm . Columns  through  show that the estimated coefﬁcients on NC_ANALYSTS are signiﬁcantly positive when DEPS is measured for the next four quarters. The magnitude of the coefﬁcient  in column  suggests that an interquartile shift in the value of NC_ANALYSTS translates into a 0.34 percent  change in DEPS, which represents 17.1 percent  of the interquartile range in one-quarter-ahead DEPS. These results are consistent with analyst interest having predictive power for DEPS in the next four quarters. In contrast, COV_  18 In subsequent regression analysis, we conduct multicollinearity diagnostics whenever explanatory variables have correlations above j0.4j. In each case, we ﬁnd that the variance inﬂation factors are below 2 for the variables tested, suggesting that multicollinearity is not an issue.  19 We thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing out this possibility and offering this solution.

The t-statistic is presented in parentheses under the estimated coefﬁcient. The dependent variable is future growth in earnings per share  in Panel A, and future sales growth  in Panel B. Variables not shown below are deﬁned in Appendix A.  Variable Deﬁnitions: DEPStþx ¼ seasonal difference in earnings per share  excluding extraordinary items scaled by the ﬁrm’s stock price as of the ﬁscal quarter ended prior to the conference call , and x ¼ 1,2,3,4 are the four ﬁscal quarters ended after the conference call;  SGROWTHtþx ¼ seasonal percentage change in quarterly sales; NC_ANALYSTS ¼ number of analysts that asked a question on the ﬁrm’s conference call, but did not cover the ﬁrm as of the date of the conference call, scaled by the number of analysts that asked a question on the ﬁrm’s conference call ; and  COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT ¼ number of analysts that covered the ﬁrm as of the date of the conference call, did not ask a question on the conference call, but did ask a question on the previous conference call, scaled by NUMCALLERS.  ANALYSTS_ABSENT does not exhibit a signiﬁcant explanatory power for future DEPS. Regarding the control variables, ROAt, BTMt, and PASTRETt exhibit signiﬁcant associations in the predicted directions. Finally, consistent with the results from Bernard and Thomas , DEPSt exhibits a positive estimated coefﬁcient in the DEPStþ1 and DEPStþ2 regressions and a negative coefﬁcient in the DEPStþ4 regression.  Table 2, Panel B shows the results of the SGROWTHx regressions. Columns  through  indicate that NC_ANALYSTS is positively associated with sales growth one to four quarters later, with the coefﬁcient highest for two quarters out . In terms of economic signiﬁcance, the coefﬁcient of 0.038 on NC_ANALYSTS in the SGROWTHtþ2 regression ) suggests that an interquartile shift in the value of NC_ANALYSTS translates into a 1.44 percent  change in sales growth two quarters later, which represents 6.00 percent  of the interquartile range in future sales growth. These ﬁndings suggest that ﬁrms with increased analyst interest are associated with sales growth over the next one to four quarters. Similar to the results in Panel A, COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT exhibits no association with future sales growth. The control variables again generally exhibit signiﬁcant associations in the predicted directions.  Overall, we ﬁnd that NC_ANALYSTS is positively related to future EPS growth and sales growth, consistent with our ﬁrst prediction, whereas COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT exhibits no predictive power with respect to changes in future fundamentals. As discussed earlier, greater measurement error in COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT  likely attenuates the coefﬁcients more toward zero, resulting in less power in our tests of analyst disinterest.  Future Change in Capital Market Activities  We next examine whether a change in analyst interest has predictive power for future changes in capital market activities, such as analyst coverage, institutional ownership, and trading volume, using the following regression model :  The Accounting Review May 2015  \\x0cAnalyst Interest as an Early Indicator of Firm Fundamental Changes and Stock Returns  1063  CMACTIVITYtþ1 ¼ b0 þ b1NC ANALYSTSt þ b2COV ANALYSTS ABSENTt  þ b3CMACTIVITYt þ b4SIZEt þ b5ROAt þ b6BTMt þ b7LEVERAGEt þ b8PASTRETt þ b9VOLATILITYt þ Year Fixed Effects þ e;  ð2Þ  where CMACTIVITYtþ1 takes one of the following three variables: CNANtþ1, CNIItþ1, or CTURNOVERtþ1, as defined in Section III and summarized in Appendix A. Prediction 2 states that the estimated coefficients on NC_ANALYSTS and COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT should be positive and negative, respectively.  We include the contemporaneous change in capital market activity, CMACTIVITYt  to address any serial correlation issues. We control for other ﬁrm characteristics that may explain cross-sectional variation in CMACTIVITYtþ1. In particular, prior studies ﬁnd that ﬁrm size  is positively related to existing levels of analyst coverage and institutional ownership . As such, we expect future changes in coverage and ownership to be smaller for larger ﬁrms. Operating performance  attracts the interest of analysts and institutional investors and, thus, is expected to be positively related to changes in the next quarter’s capital market activities. Book-to-market  proxies for the investment opportunity set, and it is expected to be negatively associated with changes in capital market activities. Leverage  captures the capital structure of the ﬁrm. As in Equation , we include past stock return  to control for confounding events that have occurred since the prior conference call date, and expect the estimated coefﬁcient to be positive. We include one additional control variable, past stock volatility , which is expected to have a negative association with future changes in capital market activities because volatile stocks are less attractive to investors. Table 3 summarizes the estimation of Equation . Column  reports the results for the CNANtþ1 regression. Consistent with our expectation, the coefﬁcient of 0.085 on NC_ANALYSTS is signiﬁcant at the 1 percent level , and its magnitude suggests that an interquartile shift in the value of NC_ANALYSTS translates into a 3.23 percent  change in analyst coverage. Since the interquartile range of CNANtþ1 is 0.19 , the marginal effect of NC_ANALYSTSt represents 17.0 percent  of that range. The coefﬁcient on COV_ ANALYSTS_ABSENT is 0.046 15.34), indicating that an interquartile shift in COV_ ANALYSTS_ABSENT translates into a 1.84 percent 0.046 3 0.40) reduction in the number of analysts following, or 9.68 percent  of the interquartile range in CNANtþ1.  When interpreting our results, we note two benchmarks. First,  the magnitudes of the incremental changes we document are comparable to prior work, which typically ﬁnds a mean change in analyst coverage of less than one analyst after a disclosure event . Second, the potential for increases in analyst coverage among our sample ﬁrms is not large, on average, because the mean number of analysts is 7.9 and the median is 6.0  and because analyst coverage is very stable over time. Thus, one should expect an unconditional increase of less than one analyst per quarter in the ﬁrst place. Untabulated analysis shows that about 20 percent of non-covering analysts initiate coverage within one year of showing up on a ﬁrm’s earnings conference call for the ﬁrst time.20 Conversely, about 14 percent of covering analysts who are absent from a given call eventually drop coverage within one year.  20 We view such a ‘‘conversion rate’’ to be signiﬁcant for several reasons:  generally, many analysts dial into many ﬁrms’ conference calls because the cost is relatively low ;  not every analyst participating on the conference call will ultimately initiate coverage for various reasons , and when analysts do decide to initiate coverage, it may take more than a year; and  analyst job changes and reassignments introduce measurement errors that reduce the conversion rate.

Table 3 presents results of regressions of next quarter’s change in analyst coverage , institutional ownership , and trading volume turnover  on the number of non-covering analysts  and covering analysts who are absent  from a ﬁrm’s earnings conference call, as well as on control variables. Variables not shown below are deﬁned in Appendix A.  Variable Deﬁnitions: CNANtþ1 ¼ percentage change in the number of analysts that covered the ﬁrm from the quarter before the conference call  to the quarter after the conference call;  CNIItþ1 ¼ percentage change in the number of institutional investors that owned the ﬁrm’s stock from the calendar  quarter ended prior to the conference call to the calendar quarter ended after the conference call;  CTURNOVERtþ1 ¼ change in average daily turnover  from the 90 days before to  the 90 days after the conference call, expressed in percentage terms;  NC_ANALYSTS ¼ number of analysts that asked a question on the ﬁrm’s conference call, but did not cover the ﬁrm as of the date of the conference call, scaled by the number of analysts that asked a question on the ﬁrm’s conference call ; and  COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT ¼ number of analysts that covered the ﬁrm as of the date of the conference call, did not ask a question on the conference call, but did ask a question on the previous conference call, scaled by NUMCALLERS.  The Accounting Review May 2015  \\x0cAnalyst Interest as an Early Indicator of Firm Fundamental Changes and Stock Returns  1065  Regarding the control variables, Table 3, column  shows that all the control variables signiﬁcantly explain changes in analyst coverage over the next quarter. In particular, ﬁrms that have already experienced greater increases in analyst coverage, are larger in size, and have high book-to- market and volatility exhibit a decrease  in future analyst coverage. Moreover, ﬁrms with high operating performance, leverage, and past returns exhibit higher increases in analyst coverage over the next quarter. Thus, the aforementioned results for NC_ANALYSTS and COV_ ANALYSTS_ABSENT are incremental to observable ﬁrm fundamentals and stock characteristics.  In Table 3, column  we report the regression results for the percentage change in the number of institutional investors, CNIItþ1. We ﬁnd a positive coefﬁcient of 0.008  on NC_ ANALYSTS, signiﬁcant at the 1 percent level. Moving NC_ANALYSTS from the ﬁrst to the third quartile translates into a 0.3 percent  increase in the percentage of institutional ownership, or 2.53 percent  of the interquartile range in CNIItþ1. The coefﬁcient on COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT is 0.004 4.87). Moving COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT from the ﬁrst to the third quartile translates into a 0.16 percent 0.001 3 0.40) decrease in CNIItþ1, or 1.33 percent  of the interquartile range in CNIItþ1. We benchmark our results against prior studies that have documented increases of less than 1 percent in institutional ownership per quarter following changes in ﬁrms’ information environment . For example, Lehavy and Sloan  show that the unconditional average quarterly percentage change in institutional ownership for ﬁrms is nearly zero from 1982 to 2004, with a mean of 0.10 percent and a median of 0.00. Only in the highest two deciles of ﬁrms ranked by changes in institutional ownership is the average greater than 0.29 percent. Therefore, we believe that the economic signiﬁcance of NC_ANALYSTS and COV_ ANALYSTS_ABSENT in explaining CNIItþ1 is relatively large. The coefﬁcients on the control that variables are largely expected and similar to those reported under column , except LEVERAGE exhibits no association with future increases in institutional ownership.  Finally, we examine whether changes in analyst interest are related to future changes in trading volume turnover. In Table 3, column  the coefﬁcient on NC_ANALYSTS is 0.022 and signiﬁcant , but the coefﬁcient on COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT is insigniﬁcant 0.53). A shift in the value of NC_ANALYSTS from the ﬁrst to the third quartile translates into a 0.84 percent  increase in CTURNOVERtþ1, or 2.88 percent  of the interquartile range in CTURNOVERtþ1. All the control variables exhibit a signiﬁcant association with the dependent variable and, with one exception , in the predicted direction.  Overall, consistent with our Prediction 2, we ﬁnd that changes in analyst interest predict subsequent capital market activities. NC_ANALYSTS is positively related to future changes in analyst coverage, institutional ownership, and trading volume, whereas COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT is negatively related to future changes in analyst coverage and institutional ownership.  Future Stock Returns  Finally, we examine whether changes in analyst interest predict future stock returns. We ﬁrst use regression analyses to test the predictive power of NC_ANALYSTSt and COV_ANALYSTS_ ABSENTt for future stock returns. For each quarterly conference call, we calculate the three-month stock return  from month mþ1 to mþ3, where m is the month during which the conference call occurs. We control for earnings news and common return factors in the following regression model:  RET ¼ b0 þ b1NC ANALYSTSt þ b2COV ANALYSTS ABSENTt þ b3ENEWSt þ b4SIZEt  þ b5BTMt þ b6RETm1;m11 þ e:  ð3Þ  The Accounting Review May 2015  \\x0c1066  Jung, Wong, and Zhang  Regressions of Future Stock Returns on Analyst Interest Variables  TABLE 4  Dependent Variable  Intercept  NC_ANALYSTSt  COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENTt  ENEWSt  SIZEt  BTMt  CNANt  CNIIt  RETm11,m1  CTURNOVERt  Adj.

The Fama and MacBeth  t-statistic is presented in parentheses under the estimated coefﬁcient. Table 4 presents results of regressions of future stock returns  on the number of non-covering analysts  and covering analysts who are absent  from a ﬁrm’s earnings conference call, as well as on control variables. The coefﬁcient estimates are the average of quarterly estimates over 27 quarters from the third quarter of 2002 to the ﬁrst quarter of 2009. Variables not shown below are deﬁned in Appendix A.  Variable Deﬁnitions: RET ¼ measured over a three-month window [mþ1, mþ3], where m is the month in which a ﬁrm’s conference call  occurred;  NC_ANALYSTS ¼ number of analysts that asked a question on the ﬁrm’s conference call, but did not cover the ﬁrm as of the date of the conference call, scaled by the number of analysts that asked a question on the ﬁrm’s conference call ; and  COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT ¼ number of analysts that covered the ﬁrm as of the date of the conference call, did not ask a question on the conference call, but did ask a question on the previous conference call, scaled by NUMCALLERS.  All variables are as previously deﬁned. Prediction 3 states that the estimated coefﬁcients on NC_ ANALYSTS and COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT should be positive and negative, respectively.  Table 4 reports the regression results. Column  shows that NC_ANALYSTSt and COV_ ANALYSTS_ABSENTt are positively and negatively, respectively, associated with future stock returns. In column  we further control for contemporaneous changes in analyst coverage , institutional ownership , and share turnover  under the premise that contemporaneous changes in capital market activities also predict future stock returns and that NC_ANALYSTSt and COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENTt are correlated with these variables. Column  indicates that both the magnitude and signiﬁcance of the estimated coefﬁcients on NC_ANALYSTSt  The Accounting Review May 2015  \\x0cAnalyst Interest as an Early Indicator of Firm Fundamental Changes and Stock Returns  1067  and COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENTt are not affected by the inclusion of the additional controls. Regarding control variables, ENEWS has a statistically positive coefﬁcient, consistent with the positive link between fundamental news and stock returns. The coefﬁcient on SIZE is negative and marginally signiﬁcant, while the coefﬁcients on BTM and RETm1,m11 are statistically insigniﬁcant. In sum, these results conﬁrm our conjecture that analyst interest is an early indicator of future stock returns.  Next, we gauge the economic signiﬁcance of the return results by comparing subsequent three- month stock returns  between the top and bottom quartiles of the analyst interest variables. The ﬁndings are presented in Table 5, Panel A. RET increases monotonically from 1.69 percent in the bottom NC_ANALYSTS quartile to 3.56 percent in the top quartile. A return difference of 1.87 percent  between the top and bottom quartiles is both statistically and economically signiﬁcant. When partitioning on COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT, we ﬁnd that RET decreases from 3.15 percent in the bottom quartile to 1.48 percent in the top quartile. A return difference of 1.67 percent 2.81) between the top and bottom quartiles is also signiﬁcant.  Finally, we use a four-factor model to show that the aforementioned return differences are not attributable to common return factors. Since risk factors are available monthly, we match NC_ ANALYSTSt and COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENTt with stock returns in months mþ1, mþ2, and mþ3, where m is the month of the conference call. For each month, we independently sort the sample into quartiles based on NC_ANALYSTSt or COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENTt, resulting in four NC_ ANALYSTSt and four COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENTt portfolios. We calculate portfolio returns, Rit, as the average stock returns of ﬁrms in each portfolio, and we estimate abnormal returns using the following four-factor model for each portfolio:  Rit  Rft ¼ a þ biMðRMt  RftÞ þ siSMBt þ hiHMLt þ miMOMt þ eit;  ð4Þ  where RMt  Rft, SMBt, and HMLt are deﬁned in Fama and French , and MOMt is the momentum factor deﬁned in Carhart . The four-factor data are from Kenneth French’s website . The intercept, a, provides an estimate of the monthly abnormal returns earned by each NC_ANALYSTSt or COV_ANALYSTS_ ABSENTt portfolio, after controlling for these four factors.  Table 5, Panel B summarizes the estimation of Equation  for all the portfolios. The intercepts from the four-factor model increase monotonically with NC_ANALYSTSt from 0.41 percent for portfolio Q1 to 0.516 percent for portfolio Q4. A hedge portfolio with a long position in Q4 stocks and a short position in Q1 stocks yields a signiﬁcant abnormal return of 0.475 percent per month or 5.7 percent per year. For the COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENTt portfolios, abnormal monthly returns decrease from 0.219 percent in portfolio Q1 to 0.007 percent in portfolio Q4. A hedge portfolio yields a signiﬁcant abnormal return of 0.226 percent per month or 2.7 percent per year. Overall, both regression and portfolio analyses suggest that the analyst interest variables predict future stock returns and that the effects are both economically and statistically signiﬁcant, consistent with Prediction 3. NC_ANALYSTS is positively related to subsequent stock returns, whereas COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT is negatively related to subsequent stock returns.  Testing the Investor Recognition Story after Controlling for Future Fundamentals  As discussed in Section II, the theories of both McNichols and O’Brien  and Merton  suggest that changes in analyst interest predict subsequent capital market activities and future stock returns. Although these two theories are not mutually exclusive, we attempt to shed light on whether Merton’s  investor recognition story holds after controlling for future fundamentals. We again note that Merton’s  theory has no direct implications for changes in future fundamentals.

Table 5 presents monthly portfolio returns based on sorting observations into quartiles based on NC_ANALYSTSt or COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENTt .

Panel B presents results of regressions of future stock returns  on NC_ANALYSTSt, COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENTt, and control variables. The results are comparable to those presented in Table 4, except that future earnings growth  and sales growth  are included in the regression to control for changes in future fundamentals. All variables are deﬁned in Appendix A.  V. ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS AND ROBUSTNESS TESTS  Alternative Explanation: Confounding Information  Confounding information, such as industry news or information released to the market by a given ﬁrm, may cause analysts to become interested in that ﬁrm. For example, if the ﬁrst reporting ﬁrm in an industry beats earnings expectations substantially due to an industry shock, then analysts will ﬂock to the next ﬁrm’s call to understand how the shock will manifest. In this case, news from  The Accounting Review May 2015  \\x0cAnalyst Interest as an Early Indicator of Firm Fundamental Changes and Stock Returns  1071  another ﬁrm may be driving analyst interest, future ﬁrm fundamentals, and stock returns.21 To address this concern, we have included PASTRET as a control variable in Tables 2 and 3, where PASTRET is stock return over the past three months up to the conference call date. In the return tests reported in Table 4, we follow the literature and use the standard 11-month stock returns, RETm11,m1, to proxy for price momentum. To check the sensitivity of the return results, we add size-adjusted PASTRET as an additional control variable. Results  are qualitatively similar to those presented in Table 4. Speciﬁcally, the t-statistic of the coefﬁcient on NC_ ANALYSTS is slightly stronger while the t-statistic of the coefﬁcient on COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT is slightly weaker, relative to the models without PASTRET.  Alternative Explanation: Upward Trend in Conference Call Likelihood and Coverage  Another alternative explanation is that there is an upward trend in conference call data  and our results could be driven by observations from only a few years. We investigate this possibility using a relatively stable subsample. In particular, we require each ﬁrm to have data for at least 21 quarters out of our 27-quarter sample period . The resultant subsample has 35,554 ﬁrm-quarter observations, compared to 55,565 observations in our full sample. The results from this reduced sample are qualitatively similar to those shown in Tables 2 through 5. For example, compared to the results shown in Table 5, Panel A, the abnormal returns on the Q4  Q1 hedge portfolio when sorted by NC_ANALYSTSt is 1.84 percent , compared to 1.87 percent  for the full sample. We also investigate the time-series pattern of our results to check whether they are driven by a few years. In the average yearly coefﬁcient on NC_ANALYSTSt and COV_ANALYSTS_ Figure 1, we plot ABSENTt in Equation . We ﬁnd that the NC_ANALYSTSt effect is positive every year and, except for 2002, the magnitudes of the coefﬁcients are comparable. The coefﬁcient on COV_ANALYSTS_ ABSENTt is negative every year except 2005 and the magnitudes are comparable. Overall, we conclude that the effect of our analyst interest variables is consistent over time.  Alternative Explanations: Microstructure Effects and Investor Overreaction  We consider market microstructure effects and investor overreaction as alternative explanations to our return results. Under the microstructure story, ﬁrms with changes in market interest, as reﬂected in changes in analyst coverage and institutional ownership, have sharp stock price movements because of the limited supply of the ﬁrm’s stock. Such price changes will reverse quickly, suggesting a negative  correlation between NC_ANALYSTSt  and stock returns in later quarters. Under the investor overreaction story, investors and analysts overreact to ﬁrm fundamental information, resulting in a temporary change in analyst interest and stock prices. This story also suggests a negative  correlation between NC_ ANALYSTSt  and stock returns in later quarters. To examine these two alternative explanations, we test ) whether NC_ANALYSTSt and COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENTt are correlated with stock returns from month mþ4 to month mþ6  and from month mþ7 to month mþ9 , where m is the month in which the conference call occurs. If either story is true, then we should ﬁnd a negative coefﬁcient on NC_ ANALYSTSt and a positive coefﬁcient on COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENTt. Table 7, Panel A reports the results; the coefﬁcient on NC_ANALYSTSt remains statistically positive in the RETqþ2 regression and becomes marginally positive in the RETqþ3 regression, inconsistent with a reversal effect. In is marginally positive in the RETqþ2 contrast,  the coefﬁcient on COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENTt  21 We thank an anonymous reviewer for this suggestion.  The Accounting Review May 2015  \\x0c1072  Jung, Wong, and Zhang  FIGURE 1 The Time-Series Pattern of the Coefﬁcients on NC_ANALYSTS and COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT  This ﬁgure charts the average quarterly coefﬁcients on NC_ANALYSTS and COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT in regression Equation  for each year in the sample period.

All variables are deﬁned in Appendix A.  regression, suggesting a small reversal, while the coefﬁcient is negative and insigniﬁcant in the RETqþ3 regression. Overall, we ﬁnd that neither microstructure effects nor investor overreaction drive our main return results, especially for those documented with increases in analyst interest .  Robustness Check: Subsamples Based on Information Environment  We partition our sample into three groups based on the number of analysts covering the ﬁrm  to examine whether the effects of analyst interest are stronger for ﬁrms with poorer information environments. The results are presented in Table 7, Panel B; the coefﬁcients on NC_ ANALYSTSt are statistically positive across all terciles, but statistical signiﬁcance declines monotonically from the bottom to the top tercile. As for COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENTt, the coefﬁcients are signiﬁcantly negative in the bottom and middle terciles and insigniﬁcant in the top tercile. Statistical signiﬁcance also declines monotonically from the bottom to the top tercile. When performing statistical tests for coefﬁcient estimates across terciles, we ﬁnd that COV_ANALYSTS_ ABSENTt has signiﬁcantly more negative coefﬁcients in the bottom tercile than in the other two terciles, while the differences in coefﬁcients on NC_ANALYSTSt are statistically insigniﬁcant across three terciles. Overall, the evidence weakly supports the idea that the predictive power of analyst interest variables on future returns is stronger for neglected ﬁrms.

The Fama and MacBeth  t-statistic is presented in parentheses under the estimated coefﬁcient. Panel A presents results of regressions of future stock returns  on the number of non-covering analysts  and covering analysts who are absent  from a ﬁrm’s earnings conference call, as well as on control variables. The results are comparable to those presented in Table 4, except that in columns  and , stock returns are measured over the three-month windows [mþ4, mþ6] and [mþ7, mþ9], respectively, where m is the month in which a ﬁrm’s conference call occurred. Panel B presents results of regressions of future stock returns  on NC_ANALYSTSt, COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENTt, and control variables. The results are comparable to those presented in Table 4, except that the sample is partitioned into terciles based on ﬁrms’ level of analyst coverage  prior to the conference call date. All variables are deﬁned in Appendix A.  Robustness Check: The Effect of Transaction Costs  While our analyses of returns show that changes in analyst interest predict future stock returns and predictive power is stronger for neglected stocks, we do not take into account transaction costs. Transaction costs include the bid-ask spread, commissions paid to a broker, and the price impact of the buy or sell order. Broker commissions have been declining over the past 15 years, with many discount brokers offering very low or even zero commissions for an unlimited number of shares per trade. The price impact depends on the trade size and can be substantial for large trades of small-cap stocks. Our conversation with a portfolio manager indicates that total transaction costs are about 15 basis points for large-cap stocks and 70 basis points for small-cap stocks  for a portfolio of $500 million. As institutional investors typically incorporate multiple signals in their trading strategies , transaction costs are shared by these multiple signals, further lowering the transaction costs to implement the strategies. Within this context, we surmise that transaction costs can reduce the proﬁtability of the NC_ANALYSTS and COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT strategies if traded alone, and that the strategies are potentially proﬁtable only to institutional investors with low transaction costs and careful execution. However, NC_ANALYSTS and COV_ANALYSTS_ABSENT can add signiﬁcant value to a portfolio that trades on multiple signals and spreads transaction costs across these signals.  Robustness Check: IPO Firms and Fourth-Quarter Effects  We examine whether the positive association between NC_ANALYSTS and future analyst coverage is driven by ﬁrms that recently had an IPO. Relative to ﬁrms that have been public for many years, recent IPO ﬁrms may exhibit larger sequential increases in analyst participation in conference calls and analyst initiations during the ﬁrst few quarters after their IPOs. We repeat our analysis after excluding all ﬁrm-quarters where a ﬁrm’s IPO occurred within the past 12 months, which reduces the sample size by 5,394 ﬁrm-quarters . We ﬁnd  The Accounting Review May 2015  \\x0cAnalyst Interest as an Early Indicator of Firm Fundamental Changes and Stock Returns  1075  that the results  and inferences are virtually unchanged from the main results discussed in Section IV.  We also examine whether there is a fourth-quarter effect driving our main results. It is possible that analyst interest in a ﬁrm’s fourth ﬁscal quarter is higher because results are aggregated for the full year, news is delayed until the fourth quarter , or analysts can ask questions about the next ﬁscal year. We investigate this possibility and its potential inﬂuence on the main results in two ways. First, we compute the mean and median number of analysts who ask a question during a conference call by quarter. We ﬁnd that the mean is 5.1 and median is 5.0 in the fourth quarter, the same as in each of the ﬁrst three quarters. Thus, it does not appear that the average level of analyst interest is signiﬁcantly different in the fourth or any other quarter. Second, we rerun regression Equations  through  with the inclusion of quarter ﬁxed effects and ﬁnd that the results are very similar to those shown in Section IV. In summary, we believe that our main results are not driven by fourth-quarter effects.  VI. CONCLUSION  In this study, we posit that analyst interest is an early indicator of a ﬁrm’s future fundamentals, capital market activities, and stock price movements. Changes in analyst interest capture changes in ﬁrm fundamentals that are not yet reﬂected in ﬁnancial statements. Our measure of increasing analyst interest in a ﬁrm is based on non-covering analysts who participate in the ﬁrm’s earnings conference calls, which we argue is an observable aspect of analysts’ due diligence prior to coverage initiations. Conversely, our measure of decreasing analyst interest  is based on covering analysts who are absent from the ﬁrm’s conference calls.  We ﬁnd that increases in analyst interest are positively associated with future fundamental changes, such as earnings growth and sales growth, after controlling for observable ﬁnancial interest are also positively statement variables and other determinants. Increases in analyst associated with future capital market activities, such as analyst coverage, institutional ownership, and trading volume turnover. In contrast, we ﬁnd weaker results based on decreases in analyst interest, which we attribute to greater noise in our measure of analyst disinterest. In our analyses of future stock returns, we show that both increases and decreases in analyst interest predict stock returns over the next three months and that a hedge portfolio yields a signiﬁcant abnormal return. Overall, our study shows that analyst is a novel and early indicator of future ﬁrm fundamentals and capital market consequences. Our focus on analyst interest prior to coverage decisions  also contributes to our general understanding of the role that analysts play in the capital markets.  interest  REFERENCES  of Accounting Research 35 : 1–24.

       "'a large literature examines the link between firm fundamentals and future stock returns . typically, the motivation for this line of research is that firm fundamentals are reflected in accounting data, which are informative about a firm future cash flows, and that investors do not fully impound this information into stock prices. but since financial statement information is backward-looking, it is beneficial for investors to identify early indicators of firm fundamental changes that are not yet reflected in financial statements. in this paper, we examine whether a change in analyst interest, proxied by either the onset of non-covering sell-side equity analysts who participate in a firm earnings conference call or by the absence of participation from covering analysts, is an early indicator of not only firm fundamental changes, but also of future capital market activities and stock returns. our focus on analyst interest stems from two observations. first, prior research shows that analysts are sophisticated experts with deep industry knowledge . based on their knowledge of new products, customers, and market opportunities within an industry, analysts are keenly aware of shifting competitive positions between industry leaders, laggards, up-and-comers, and new entrant firms. their expertise allows them to foresee future changes in firmsâ€™ fundamentals, well before such information is reflected in the financial statements of individual firms. second, before an analyst initiates coverage on a firm, he or she must conduct due diligence. analyst due diligence has not been explored in the extant literature, as many of the activities analysts perform before and after coverage initiations have been described as a black box . we explore one aspect of analyst due diligence and document that analysts regularly participate in a firm earnings conference calls before initiating coverage on the firm.1 this practice is common because listening to and asking a question during a firm conference call is part of an extensive, and sometimes lengthy, due diligence process. for example, sanford c. bernstein & co., a top-ranked sell-side equity research firm in institutional investor annual all-american research survey, gives newly hired analysts up to one year to conduct due diligence on firms before initiating coverage on them . in a similar vein, analysts who already cover a firm are often absent from, or silent on , the firm conference call if they have lost interest in the firm or intend to drop coverage.2 we posit that an onset of analysts who do not cover a given firm , but participate in that firm earnings conference call, captures increasing analyst interest in the firm, while analyst absenteeism captures decreasing analyst interest in the firm.'"

      "  in this paper, we examine whether a change in analyst interest, proxied by either the onset of non-covering sell-side equity analysts who participate in a firm earnings conference call or by the absence of participation from covering analysts, is an early indicator of not only firm fundamental changes, but also of future capital market activities and stock returns. 2 we posit that an onset of analysts who do not cover a given firm , but participate in that firm earnings conference call, captures increasing analyst interest in the firm, while analyst absenteeism captures decreasing analyst interest in the firm. , a top-ranked sell-side equity research firm in institutional investor annual all-american research survey, gives newly hired analysts up to one year to conduct due diligence on firms before initiating coverage on them .  we explore one aspect of analyst due diligence and document that analysts regularly participate in a firm earnings conference calls before initiating coverage on the firm.  in a similar vein, analysts who already cover a firm are often absent from, or silent on , the firm conference call if they have lost interest in the firm or intend to drop coverage\n"
